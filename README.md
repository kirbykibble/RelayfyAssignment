## Other Information
A lot of the provided code was refactored to rely more heavily on the JavaScript DOM. This is due to a personal familiarity with the subject matter. Regardless, I am ready and willing to become more familiar with jQuery.

The provided assignment is mobile friendly! This is achieved primarily through flex-boxing, and should be usable on most mobile screen sizes. It is also friendly for the visually-imparied, with high-contrast colors and simple, easy to read font.
